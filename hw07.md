IR:

　　IR(Instruction Register) is the register that contains the instruction that is currently being excuted.

PC:

　　PC(Program Counter) is the register that contains the address of the next instruction to be excuted.

ACC registers:

　　The accumulator is used to hold data and the results of operations.

## 4）
Given a and c in binary system, and use an AND Gate to compute every corresponding bits.

Example:

(STO A)
| Instruction specifier | Operand specifier | 
|:--|:--|
| 11100000 | 0000000000000111 |
Instruction specifier : the 1st to 4th bit is Opcode , in this case , “1110” means “Store the A register to the operand”,the 5th bit is Regiester specifier or 5th bit of Opcode. The 6th to 8th bit means Addressing mode, in this case, “000” means Immediate addressing mode.

Operand specifier : Operand specifier (the second and third bytes of the instruction) holds either the operand itself or the address of where the operand is to be found. In this case,”0000000000000111” means either the operand itself or the place named in the operand

汇编语言(Assembly Language)

　　An assembly (or assembler) language, often abbreviated asm, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program’s statements and the architecture’s machine code instructions. Assembly language may also be called symbolic machine code.
## 2）
编译(Compiler)

　　A compiler is computer software that primarily translates computer code from a high-level programming language to machine code to create an executable program. A compiler can also be used to convert computer code written in one programming language into another programming language. Technically compilers are a type of translator that support digital devices, primarily computers.
## 3）
命令式语言(Imperative programming)

　　In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program’s state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.
## 4）
函数编程语言(Functional programming)

　　In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.
## 5）
过程式编程(Procedural programming)

　　Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program’s execution, including by other procedures or itself.
