# 1

Five components: The Memory Unit、The Control Unit、The Arithmetic Logic Unit、The Input Unit、The Output Unit.

# 2

64MB=$2^{26}$Bytes


So 26 bits are needed.

# 3
The Control Unit、The Arithmetic Logic Unit.The von Neumann architecture didn’t include cache memory,but today’s CPU includes cache memory.

## 1
Auxiliary memory[citation needed], also known as auxiliary storage, secondary storage, secondary memory or external memory, is a non-volatile memory (does not lose stored data when the device is powered down) that is not directly accessible by the CPU, because it is not accessed via the input/output channels (it is an external device). In RAM devices (as flash memory) data can be directly deleted or changed.
## 2
Solid State Disk and mechanical hard disk.

CPU:

A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. 

RAM:

Random-access memory (RAM /ræm/) is a form of computer data storage that stores data and machine code currently being used.

ROM:

Read-only memory (ROM) is a type of non-volatile memory used in computers and other electronic devices. Data stored in ROM can only be modified slowly, with difficulty, or not at all, so it is mainly used to store firmware (software that is closely tied to specific hardware, and unlikely to need frequent updates) or application software in plug-in cartridges.

Bus(computing):

　　In computer architecture, a bus (a contraction of the Latin omnibus) is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or between computers. This expression covers all related hardware components (wire, optical fiber, etc.) and software, including communication protocols.

Parallel Computing:

　　Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously.Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time. There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction-level, data, and task parallelism. Parallelism has long been employed in high-performance computing, but it’s gaining broader interest due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling.As power consumption (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years,parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture, mainly in the form of multi-core processors.

云计算（cloud computing），是一种基于互联网的计算方式，通过这种方式，共享的软硬件资源和信息可以按需求提供给计算机各种终端和其他设备。

# 7
## 1)
“3”是指第三代双倍速率同步动态随机存储器，“1333”指的是默认工作频率是1333MHZ。
## 2)
性能没有提升。
## 3)
能提高性能。
## 4）
16G=$2^{34}$Bytes

So 34 bits are needed.
